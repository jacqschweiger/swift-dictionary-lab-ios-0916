/*: question1
 ### 1. Given the following states, New York, Ohio, Florida, Georgia and Kentucky, create a dictionary which stores these states along with their capitals. The capitals of these states are as follows (in the correct order), Albany, Columbus, Tallahassee, Atlanta, and Frankfort.

 ### 3. Create a variable called `capital` and assign to it Florida's capital from the dictionary.

 ### 4. Unwrap `capital` and print out the message "The capital of Florida is <Capital>" to the console.

 ### 5. Create a variable called `anotherCapital` and assign to it the value of Pennsylvania's capital from the dictionary.

 ### 6. Unwrap `anotherCapital` and print out the message "I don't know Pennsylvania's capital" to the console.

 ### 7. Pennsylvania's capital is Harrisburg. Add it to your state capitals dictionary.

 ### 10. You have been given the constant `state` with a state name. Use that constant to retrieve the state's capital from the dictionary. Print "The capital of <State> is <Capital>" to the console.

/*: question11
 ### 11. Dictionaries don't have to contain just `String` keys and values. Create a dictionary that contains the name of a band, and the members of that band. Here are the bands and members that you can use:

 * Nirvana: Kurt Cobain, Krist Novoselic, Dave Grohl
 * The Beatles: John Lennon, George Harrison, Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr
 * The Breeders: Kim Deal, Kelley Deal, Josephine Wiggs, Jim Macpherson
 * Pixies: Frank Black, Joey Santiago, Kim Deal, David Lovering

 Since there are multiple members for each band, the value of each key should be an `Array`.
